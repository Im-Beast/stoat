# [🦦](## "Yes, this is an otter, there's no stoat emoji :(") Stoat

Stoat is a simple, agile interpreted programming language.\
It's currently in a **very** work in progress state.

Keep in mind I have basically no experience regarding actually writing
programming languages, so this is meant to be a nice challenge where I can learn
a lot of stuff along the way.

## 🎯 Basic "goals"

- Rust-like syntax
- Very simple to just get going
- Smol
- Be able to complete aoc 2024 in it

## 📝 What needs to be done

- [ ] – Custom types (structs/enums)
- [ ] – Traits/methods
- [ ] – Static type checking
- [ ] – Bug squashing
